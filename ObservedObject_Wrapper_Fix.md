# ObservedObject Wrapper Fix

## Issue Resolved ‚úÖ
The error `Referencing subscript 'subscript(dynamicMember:)' requires wrapper 'ObservedObject<SummaryManager>.Wrapper'` in `EnhancedSummaryDetailView.swift` has been resolved.

## Root Cause
The error occurred because:
1. The `SummaryManager` class was missing several methods that were being called
2. The file structure was malformed with misplaced closing braces
3. Dependencies on classes that don't exist yet (AI engines, extractors, etc.)

## Solution Applied

### 1. Fixed SummaryManager Structure
- Corrected malformed class structure with misplaced closing braces
- Ensured all methods are properly within the class scope
- Added missing `setEngine` method (temporarily disabled)

### 2. Simplified Implementation
Since the full AI engine system isn't implemented yet, I created a basic implementation:

```swift
func generateEnhancedSummary(from text: String, for recordingURL: URL, recordingName: String, recordingDate: Date) async throws -> EnhancedSummaryData {
    print("ü§ñ SummaryManager: Using basic summarization (engine system not fully implemented)")
    
    let startTime = Date()
    
    // Use basic processing for now
    let contentType = ContentType.general
    let summary = createBasicSummary(from: text, contentType: contentType)
    let tasks: [TaskItem] = []
    let reminders: [ReminderItem] = []
    
    let processingTime = Date().timeIntervalSince(startTime)
    
    let enhancedSummary = EnhancedSummaryData(
        recordingURL: recordingURL,
        recordingName: recordingName,
        recordingDate: recordingDate,
        summary: summary,
        tasks: tasks,
        reminders: reminders,
        contentType: contentType,
        aiMethod: "Basic Processing",
        originalLength: text.components(separatedBy: .whitespacesAndNewlines).filter { !$0.isEmpty }.count,
        processingTime: processingTime
    )
    
    await MainActor.run {
        saveEnhancedSummary(enhancedSummary)
    }
    
    return enhancedSummary
}
```

### 3. Temporarily Disabled Features
- AI engine initialization (commented out until engines are implemented)
- Complex content analysis (using basic sentence extraction)
- Task and reminder extraction (returning empty arrays)
- Recording name generation (using original name)

## Files Modified
- `Audio Journal/Audio Journal/SummaryManager.swift` - Fixed structure and added basic implementations
- `Audio Journal/Audio Journal/EnhancedSummaryDetailView.swift` - Commented out engine selection

## Current Status
‚úÖ **Compilation Fixed** - The code should now compile without the ObservedObject wrapper error
‚ö†Ô∏è **Limited Functionality** - Some advanced features are temporarily disabled

## Next Steps for Full Implementation

### 1. Implement Missing Classes
Create these classes that are referenced but don't exist:
- `AIEngineType` enum
- `AIEngineFactory` class
- `TaskExtractor` class
- `ReminderExtractor` class
- `ContentAnalyzer` class
- `LocalLLMEngine` class

### 2. Restore Full Engine System
Once the missing classes are implemented:
- Uncomment `initializeEngines()` call in init
- Restore full `generateEnhancedSummary` implementation
- Enable engine selection in UI

### 3. Add Advanced Features
- Content type classification
- Task extraction from text
- Reminder extraction with time parsing
- Intelligent recording name generation

## Temporary Limitations
- Summaries use basic sentence extraction instead of AI
- No task or reminder extraction
- No content type classification
- No recording renaming
- Engine selection is disabled

The app should now compile and run, but with reduced functionality until the full AI system is implemented.
