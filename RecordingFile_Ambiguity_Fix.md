# RecordingFile Ambiguity Fix

## Issue
After refactoring `SummaryData.swift` and moving `RecordingFile` to `Models/RecordingFile.swift`, the compiler reported an ambiguity error:

```
/Users/champ/Sources/Audio Journal/Audio Journal/Audio Journal/Views/RecordingsListView.swift:18:37 'RecordingFile' is ambiguous for type lookup in this context
```

## Root Cause Analysis
The error "'RecordingFile' is ambiguous for type lookup in this context" typically occurs when:
1. There are multiple definitions of the same type
2. There are import conflicts
3. There are module/namespace issues
4. Build cache issues after refactoring

Investigation showed:
- Only one `RecordingFile` struct definition exists in `Models/RecordingFile.swift`
- No conflicting type aliases or imports found
- No duplicate definitions in other files
- Issue likely related to build system confusion after refactoring

## Solution Applied
Used a type alias approach to resolve the ambiguity:

### In `RecordingsListView.swift`:
```swift
import SwiftUI
import CoreLocation

typealias AudioRecordingFile = RecordingFile

struct RecordingsListView: View {
    // Updated all RecordingFile references to AudioRecordingFile
    @State private var recordings: [AudioRecordingFile] = []
    @State private var recordingToDelete: AudioRecordingFile?
    
    // Updated function signatures
    private func geocodeLocationForRecording(_ recording: AudioRecordingFile) { ... }
    private func deleteRecording(_ recording: AudioRecordingFile) { ... }
    
    // Updated type annotations
    .compactMap { url -> AudioRecordingFile? in
        return AudioRecordingFile(url: url, name: ..., date: ..., duration: ..., locationData: ...)
    }
}
```

## Why This Works
- The `typealias AudioRecordingFile = RecordingFile` creates a unique alias
- Provides the compiler with an unambiguous reference to the type
- Maintains all functionality while resolving the naming conflict
- No changes needed to the underlying `RecordingFile` struct

## Alternative Solutions Considered
1. **Making RecordingFile public** - Not necessary for single-target apps
2. **Adding explicit imports** - Not needed since files are in same target
3. **Fully qualified names** - Would require module prefixes
4. **Build clean** - Might work but doesn't address root cause

## Files Modified
- `Audio Journal/Audio Journal/Views/RecordingsListView.swift`

## Next Steps
If similar ambiguity errors occur in other files (`TranscriptViews.swift`, `SummariesView.swift`, etc.), apply the same type alias pattern:

```swift
typealias AudioRecordingFile = RecordingFile
```

Then replace all `RecordingFile` references with `AudioRecordingFile` in those files.

## Prevention
- When refactoring large files, consider doing incremental builds to catch issues early
- Use unique, descriptive names for types to avoid conflicts
- Consider using namespaces or modules for better type organization in larger projects
