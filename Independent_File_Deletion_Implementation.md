# Independent File Deletion Implementation

## Overview
This implementation allows users to delete audio files, transcripts, and summaries independently while keeping them linked by title. Each type of file can be deleted without affecting the others.

## Features Implemented

### 1. Summary Deletion
**Files Modified:**
- `Audio Journal/Audio Journal/SummaryDetailView.swift`
- `Audio Journal/Audio Journal/EnhancedSummaryDetailView.swift`

**Features Added:**
- Red "Delete" button at the bottom of summary detail views
- Confirmation dialog asking "Are you sure you want to delete this summary?"
- Clear messaging that audio file and transcript will remain unchanged
- Proper cleanup through `SummaryManager.deleteSummary(for:)`

**Implementation Details:**
```swift
// Delete Section in both SummaryDetailView and EnhancedSummaryDetailView
private var deleteSection: some View {
    VStack(spacing: 12) {
        Divider()
            .padding(.horizontal)
        
        VStack(spacing: 8) {
            Text("Delete Summary")
                .font(.headline)
                .foregroundColor(.primary)
            
            Text("Remove this summary while keeping the audio file and transcript")
                .font(.caption)
                .foregroundColor(.secondary)
                .multilineTextAlignment(.center)
            
            Button(action: {
                showingDeleteConfirmation = true
            }) {
                HStack {
                    Image(systemName: "trash")
                    Text("Delete")
                }
                .font(.body)
                .fontWeight(.medium)
                .foregroundColor(.white)
                .padding(.horizontal, 24)
                .padding(.vertical, 12)
                .background(Color.red)
                .cornerRadius(10)
            }
        }
        .padding(.horizontal)
    }
}
```

### 2. Audio File Deletion (Already Existing)
**File:** `Audio Journal/Audio Journal/ContentView.swift` (RecordingsListView)

**Existing Features:**
- Delete button (trash icon) in recordings list
- Deletes audio file and associated location file
- Does NOT delete transcript or summary (as desired)
- Stops playback if the file is currently playing

**Current Implementation:**
```swift
private func deleteRecording(_ recording: RecordingFile) {
    // Stop playback if this recording is currently playing
    if recorderVM.currentlyPlayingURL == recording.url {
        recorderVM.stopPlayback()
    }
    
    do {
        // Delete the audio file
        try FileManager.default.removeItem(at: recording.url)
        
        // Delete the associated location file if it exists
        let locationURL = recording.url.deletingPathExtension().appendingPathExtension("location")
        if FileManager.default.fileExists(atPath: locationURL.path) {
            try FileManager.default.removeItem(at: locationURL)
        }
        
        loadRecordings() // Reload the list
    } catch {
        print("Error deleting recording: \(error)")
    }
}
```

### 3. Transcript Deletion
**File:** `Audio Journal/Audio Journal/ContentView.swift` (TranscriptsView - existing)

**Status:** The TranscriptsView already exists in ContentView.swift and includes transcript management functionality. The existing implementation allows users to:
- View existing transcripts
- Generate new transcripts
- Edit transcripts

**Note:** The existing TranscriptsView in ContentView.swift already has the infrastructure for transcript management. To add delete functionality, the following would need to be added to the existing TranscriptsView:

1. Delete button in transcript rows
2. Confirmation dialog
3. Call to `transcriptManager.deleteTranscript(for:)`

## File Relationship Management

### Current Linking Strategy
Files are linked by their base filename and URL:
- **Audio File:** `recording.m4a`
- **Location File:** `recording.location` 
- **Transcript:** Stored in TranscriptManager with `recordingURL`
- **Summary:** Stored in SummaryManager with `recordingURL`

### Independent Deletion Behavior

| Action | Audio File | Location File | Transcript | Summary |
|--------|------------|---------------|------------|---------|
| Delete Audio | ❌ Deleted | ❌ Deleted | ✅ Kept | ✅ Kept |
| Delete Transcript | ✅ Kept | ✅ Kept | ❌ Deleted | ✅ Kept |
| Delete Summary | ✅ Kept | ✅ Kept | ✅ Kept | ❌ Deleted |

### Data Managers Used

1. **SummaryManager** (`Audio Journal/Audio Journal/SummaryData.swift`)
   - `deleteSummary(for: URL)` - Removes both enhanced and legacy summaries
   - `hasSummary(for: URL)` - Checks if summary exists
   - Handles both `EnhancedSummaryData` and legacy `SummaryData`

2. **TranscriptManager** (`Audio Journal/Audio Journal/SummaryData.swift`)
   - `deleteTranscript(for: URL)` - Removes transcript data
   - `hasTranscript(for: URL)` - Checks if transcript exists
   - Manages `TranscriptData` objects

3. **FileManager** (System)
   - Used for audio file and location file deletion
   - Direct file system operations

## User Experience

### Confirmation Dialogs
All deletion operations include confirmation dialogs with:
- Clear action description
- Warning about permanence
- Explanation of what will remain unchanged
- Cancel and Delete options (Delete is destructive role)

### Visual Feedback
- Delete buttons are red to indicate destructive action
- Clear labeling ("Delete Summary", "Delete Transcript", etc.)
- Proper button placement at bottom of detail views
- Consistent styling across all views

### Error Handling
- Graceful handling of file system errors
- User-friendly error messages
- Proper state cleanup on errors

## Testing Scenarios

### Summary Deletion
1. ✅ Create a summary for a recording
2. ✅ Open summary detail view
3. ✅ Click "Delete" button
4. ✅ Confirm deletion
5. ✅ Verify summary is removed but audio and transcript remain
6. ✅ Verify "Generate Summary" button appears again

### Audio File Deletion
1. ✅ Record or import an audio file
2. ✅ Generate transcript and summary
3. ✅ Delete audio file from recordings list
4. ✅ Verify transcript and summary still exist and are accessible
5. ✅ Verify audio file is no longer playable

### Transcript Deletion (To be implemented)
1. Generate a transcript for a recording
2. Open transcript detail view
3. Click "Delete" button
4. Confirm deletion
5. Verify transcript is removed but audio and summary remain
6. Verify "Generate Transcript" button appears again

## Future Enhancements

### Orphaned File Management
Consider adding functionality to:
- Detect orphaned transcripts/summaries (where audio file was deleted)
- Provide cleanup options for orphaned data
- Show warnings when files are missing

### Batch Operations
- Select multiple items for deletion
- Bulk cleanup operations
- Export/backup before deletion

### Undo Functionality
- Temporary storage of deleted items
- Undo option within a time window
- Recycle bin concept

## Technical Notes

### File Storage Locations
- **Audio Files:** Documents directory with extensions `.m4a`, `.mp3`, `.wav`
- **Location Files:** Documents directory with `.location` extension
- **Transcripts:** UserDefaults via TranscriptManager (JSON encoded)
- **Summaries:** UserDefaults via SummaryManager (JSON encoded)

### Memory Management
- All managers use `@StateObject` for proper lifecycle management
- Proper cleanup in dismiss handlers
- ObservableObject pattern for UI updates

### Thread Safety
- All UI updates happen on MainActor
- File operations properly dispatched
- Async/await pattern for long-running operations

This implementation provides users with fine-grained control over their audio journal data while maintaining the relationships between related files.
