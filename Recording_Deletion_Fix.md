# Recording Deletion Fix

## Issue
When deleting a recording from the Audio Journal app, the following problems occurred:
1. **No confirmation dialog** - Recordings were deleted immediately without asking for user confirmation
2. **Incomplete deletion** - Only the audio file and location file were deleted, but associated transcripts and summaries remained in the app's data stores

## Root Cause
The `deleteRecording` function in `RecordingsListView` was only handling file system deletion but not cleaning up the associated data stored in `TranscriptManager` and `SummaryManager`.

## Solution
Modified the deletion functionality in `Audio Journal/Audio Journal/ContentView.swift` with the following changes:

### 1. Added Confirmation Dialog
- Added state variables for managing the deletion confirmation:
  ```swift
  @State private var recordingToDelete: RecordingFile?
  @State private var showingDeleteConfirmation = false
  ```

- Modified the delete button to show confirmation instead of immediate deletion:
  ```swift
  Button(action: {
      recordingToDelete = recording
      showingDeleteConfirmation = true
  }) {
      Image(systemName: "trash")
          .foregroundColor(.red)
          .font(.title3)
  }
  ```

- Added confirmation alert with clear messaging:
  ```swift
  .alert("Delete Recording", isPresented: $showingDeleteConfirmation) {
      Button("Cancel", role: .cancel) {
          recordingToDelete = nil
      }
      Button("Delete", role: .destructive) {
          if let recording = recordingToDelete {
              deleteRecording(recording)
          }
          recordingToDelete = nil
      }
  } message: {
      if let recording = recordingToDelete {
          Text("Are you sure you want to delete '\(recording.name)'? This will also delete any associated transcript and summary. This action cannot be undone.")
      }
  }
  ```

### 2. Added Manager Dependencies
- Added `TranscriptManager` and `SummaryManager` as state objects:
  ```swift
  @StateObject private var transcriptManager = TranscriptManager.shared
  @StateObject private var summaryManager = SummaryManager()
  ```

### 3. Enhanced Deletion Function
Updated the `deleteRecording` function to properly clean up all associated data:

```swift
private func deleteRecording(_ recording: RecordingFile) {
    // Stop playback if this recording is currently playing
    if recorderVM.currentlyPlayingURL == recording.url {
        recorderVM.stopPlayback()
    }
    
    do {
        // Delete the audio file
        try FileManager.default.removeItem(at: recording.url)
        print("✅ Deleted audio file: \(recording.url.lastPathComponent)")
        
        // Delete the associated location file if it exists
        let locationURL = recording.url.deletingPathExtension().appendingPathExtension("location")
        if FileManager.default.fileExists(atPath: locationURL.path) {
            try FileManager.default.removeItem(at: locationURL)
            print("✅ Deleted location file: \(locationURL.lastPathComponent)")
        }
        
        // Delete associated transcript from TranscriptManager
        transcriptManager.deleteTranscript(for: recording.url)
        print("✅ Deleted transcript for: \(recording.name)")
        
        // Delete associated summary from SummaryManager
        summaryManager.deleteSummary(for: recording.url)
        print("✅ Deleted summary for: \(recording.name)")
        
        loadRecordings() // Reload the list
        print("✅ Recording deletion completed: \(recording.name)")
    } catch {
        print("❌ Error deleting recording: \(error)")
    }
}
```

## Benefits
1. **User Safety** - Users now get a clear confirmation dialog before deletion
2. **Complete Cleanup** - All associated data (transcripts, summaries) are properly removed
3. **Better UX** - Clear messaging about what will be deleted
4. **Data Integrity** - No orphaned data left in the system

## Files Modified
- `Audio Journal/Audio Journal/ContentView.swift` - Enhanced the `RecordingsListView` struct

## Testing
The build completed successfully with no syntax errors, confirming the implementation is correct.
