# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature involves restoring the AI summarization functionality that was previously commented out during a refactoring process. The system needs to support multiple AI engines including Apple Intelligence, OpenAI, and local LLM implementations to provide audio transcription summaries. The goal is to re-enable the complete AI engine infrastructure that was temporarily disabled.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a user, I want to generate AI summaries of my audio recordings using different AI engines, so that I can get intelligent insights from my journal entries and other recordings.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user requests a summary THEN the system SHALL provide options for Apple Intelligence, OpenAI, and a local LLM engine using ollama
2. WHEN an AI engine is selected THEN the system SHALL process the audio transcription and generate a relevant summary using markdown with all relevant markdown abilities to highlight, create outlines and otherwise make a clean summary for easy and simple review
3. WHEN multiple engines are available THEN the system SHALL allow users to switch between different AI providers
4. IF an AI engine fails THEN the system SHALL gracefully handle the error and provide feedback to the user

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the AI engine infrastructure to be properly initialized and configured, so that all AI summarization features work reliably.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application starts THEN the system SHALL initialize all available AI engines
2. WHEN engines are initialized THEN the system SHALL verify their availability and configuration
3. IF an engine fails to initialize THEN the system SHALL log the error and continue with available engines
4. WHEN engines are ready THEN the system SHALL make them available for summarization requests

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user, I want the system to intelligently extract tasks and reminders from my audio content, so that I can act on important items mentioned in my recordings.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN audio content is processed THEN the system SHALL analyze it for actionable tasks
2. WHEN tasks are identified THEN the system SHALL extract them with relevant context
3. WHEN reminders are mentioned THEN the system SHALL identify and categorize them appropriately
4. WHEN content is analyzed THEN the system SHALL classify the type of content for better processing

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user, I want the system to automatically generate meaningful names for my recordings based on their content, so that I can easily identify and organize my journal entries.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a recording is processed THEN the system SHALL analyze the content to generate a descriptive name
2. WHEN generating names THEN the system SHALL use the most relevant topics or themes from the content
3. IF content analysis fails THEN the system SHALL fall back to timestamp-based naming
4. WHEN names are generated THEN they SHALL be concise but descriptive of the recording's main content
5. WHEN generating names THEN the system SHALL include a date of when the recording was made OR if that isn't available, the date when the summary was run
