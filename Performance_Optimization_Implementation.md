    let state: UIDevice.BatteryState
    let isLowPowerMode: Bool
    
    var isLowBattery: Bool {
        return level < 0.2 || isLowPowerMode
    }
    
    var shouldOptimizeForBattery: Bool {
        return level < 0.3 || isLowPowerMode
    }
}
```

### Optimization Levels
```swift
enum OptimizationLevel {
    case balanced
    case batteryOptimized
    case memoryOptimized
}
```

### Streaming File Processing
```swift
func processLargeFileWithStreaming(_ url: URL, chunkSize: Int = 1024 * 1024) async throws -> Data {
    // Memory-efficient streaming with progress tracking
    // Battery-aware processing delays
    // Autorelease pool management
}
```

### Adaptive Sync Intervals
```swift
private func calculateAdaptiveSyncInterval() -> TimeInterval {
    var interval: TimeInterval = 300 // 5 minutes default
    
    if performanceOptimizer.batteryInfo.shouldOptimizeForBattery {
        interval = 600 // 10 minutes for battery optimization
    }
    
    // Additional adjustments based on network and memory
    return interval
}
```
