# Standardized Title Generation Implementation

## Overview

This document outlines the implementation of standardized title generation logic across all AI summary engines in the Audio Journal app. The goal was to ensure consistent title generation behavior that matches Ollama's proven logic.

## Changes Made

### 1. Created Standardized Title Generation Utilities

**File: `Audio Journal/Audio Journal/Models/RecordingNameGenerator.swift`**

Added two new static functions:
- `generateStandardizedTitlePrompt(from text: String) -> String`: Generates the standardized prompt for title generation
- `cleanStandardizedTitleResponse(_ response: String) -> String`: Cleans and validates AI-generated titles using Ollama's proven logic

### 2. Updated All AI Engines

#### Ollama Service
**File: `Audio Journal/Audio Journal/OllamaService.swift`**
- Updated `generateTitle(from text: String)` to use `RecordingNameGenerator.generateStandardizedTitlePrompt()`
- Updated title cleaning to use `RecordingNameGenerator.cleanStandardizedTitleResponse()`

#### OpenAI Summarization Service
**File: `Audio Journal/Audio Journal/OpenAISummarizationService.swift`**
- Updated `extractTitles(from text: String)` to use standardized prompt
- Added fallback logic to handle non-JSON responses using standardized cleaning
- Maintains JSON format for structured responses while supporting plain text fallback

#### Enhanced Apple Intelligence Engine
**File: `Audio Journal/Audio Journal/EnhancedAppleIntelligenceEngine.swift`**
- Updated `extractTitles(from text: String)` to apply standardized title cleaning
- Enhanced local processing with standardized validation logic
- Prioritizes high-confidence titles with standardized cleaning

#### Google AI Studio Service
**File: `Audio Journal/Audio Journal/GoogleAIStudioService.swift`**
- Added complete `extractTitles(from text: String)` implementation
- Uses standardized prompt generation
- Includes JSON parsing with fallback to plain text extraction
- Added helper methods for JSON response parsing

### 3. Created Test Infrastructure

**File: `Audio Journal/Audio Journal/TitleGenerationTest.swift`**
- Created comprehensive test view for verifying standardized title generation
- Tests all AI engines with the same input text
- Provides visual comparison of results across engines
- Includes Google AI Studio engine wrapper for testing

## Standardized Title Generation Logic

### Prompt Structure
All engines now use the same prompt that includes:
- Clear length requirements (20-50 characters, 3-8 words)
- Specific examples of good titles
- Emphasis on meaningful, specific content
- Proper capitalization requirements
- Clear formatting instructions

### Response Cleaning Logic
Standardized cleaning includes:
- Removal of `<think>` tags and content
- Quote removal
- Prefix/suffix cleaning (Title:, Name:, etc.)
- Word count pattern removal
- Markdown formatting removal
- End punctuation removal
- Length validation and truncation
- Quality validation (word count, repetition, generic terms)
- Fallback to "Untitled Conversation" for poor results

### Quality Validation
Titles are validated for:
- Minimum 2 words, maximum 8 words
- No excessive word repetition (>40% unique words)
- No generic terms when used alone
- Proper length (20-50 characters)
- Meaningful content

## Benefits

1. **Consistency**: All AI engines now generate titles with the same quality standards
2. **Reliability**: Proven Ollama logic applied across all engines
3. **Maintainability**: Centralized title generation logic in `RecordingNameGenerator`
4. **Quality**: Enhanced validation prevents poor or generic titles
5. **Fallback Support**: Graceful handling of different response formats

## Testing

The `TitleGenerationTest.swift` file provides a comprehensive test interface that:
- Tests all AI engines with identical input
- Compares results across engines
- Validates standardized behavior
- Provides visual feedback on title quality

## Engine Coverage

The following AI engines now use standardized title generation:
- ✅ Ollama (Local LLM)
- ✅ OpenAI (GPT models)
- ✅ Apple Intelligence (On-device processing)
- ✅ Google AI Studio (Gemini models)
- ✅ OpenAI API Compatible (Local/remote models)

## Future Considerations

1. **Performance Monitoring**: Track title generation success rates across engines
2. **User Feedback**: Collect user preferences for title styles
3. **Engine-Specific Optimization**: Fine-tune prompts for specific engine capabilities
4. **A/B Testing**: Compare standardized vs. engine-specific title generation

## Implementation Notes

- All changes maintain backward compatibility
- Existing title extraction methods continue to work
- Enhanced error handling for different response formats
- Centralized logic reduces code duplication
- Test infrastructure enables ongoing validation
